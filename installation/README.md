# Installation Tools

The tools that you will need to have set up are below. Follow along with the 
install instructions in the `.md` files in this folder, and install 
these in the following order: 

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/docs/v0.191.0/getting-started-installing-atom) (or some other sort of text editor)
* [git](https://www.git-scm.com/download/vim) 
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) (there's no `.md` file for this because in reading this README.md you have hopefully already set it up)

The goal of this introduction is to assist you with getting these items up 
and running. If you can't get them up and running, come to your meetup and we'll do our best to help!
